ideas:
day before survey ends if haven't taken automatic email reminder
sort account tables by x feature

requirements:
once create a survey , go to survey.php?url=eerkdfjalskj (SORT OF)
send recipients email, (YES) then go to the url and see the survey, (SORT OF) and theoretically answer it

thoughts:
survey.php 87-89: insert here how to load the various numbers of questions /
      figure it'd be something like: for each column in survey table with stuff in it,
      load content of that column and make input space for it

problems:
cannot save dates. not working.
need counter for dynamic inclusion of emails / questions
the javascript method post wasn't working, had to put it in the html form

didn't get to:
saving questions/answers in database
pulling specific survey contents to specific url
encrypting email of survey respondent for anonymity
